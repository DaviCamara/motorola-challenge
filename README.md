Solution in JavaEE for a challenge proposode by Motorolla Solutions as as assesement test of skills and proeficiency.

The solution was built utilizing JavaEE for the backEnd and JPanel for the input. 

The Challenge Solution was built Following the SOLID principles applying the MVC pattern. It was also a central value to develope a solution, utilizing the most ammount of Native Java Code possible. Therefore it was minimized the ammount of Libraries used.

The challenge consistede into recieving a Input from the User and parsing the Strings, counting the ammount of times it character appered in the provided String, ignoring, blank/empy spaces and numbers. Printing trought each iteration of the program, the identified char + how many times it apperead. Altough the final method had O (n*n) = nÂ². The algorithm, parses any provided string, being easy to adjust the filtering parameters. It was also a concern to minimize space complexity. Since it was a requirement to ignore the undesired inputs.
